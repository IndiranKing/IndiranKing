üîç Refined Understanding

WFM (Canvas / CoE)

Does NOT explicitly set Circuit Delivered Date.

It sets Transport Completed (Est & Act) dates ‚Üí these are the true physical completion milestones.

These dates are passed downstream.


FUZE Ordering (onef-ordercollection-service)

Takes the Transport Completed Actual Date from WFM.

In FUZE Ordering, this is displayed as ‚ÄúIN EFFECT Date‚Äù.

üëâ So FUZE Ordering is where Transport Completed Actual Date is re-interpreted as Circuit Delivered Date.


FUZE Sync (onefiber-sync / rewrite)

Responsible for taking this ‚ÄúIN EFFECT Date‚Äù from FUZE Ordering and updating FUZE Projects DB.

Should persist it into PROJ_TRANSPORT_ATTRIBUTES ‚Üí TRANS_CONTR_FOC_FC_DT (transContrFocAcDt).


FUZE Projects (projects-service)

Only reads from DB (and currently shows NULL because sync didn‚Äôt persist).

‚úÖ Corrected Source of Truth

WFM: Sends Transport Completed Actual Date (not Circuit Delivered).

FUZE Ordering: Translates this as Circuit Delivered (IN EFFECT Date).

FUZE Projects: Should display it as Circuit Delivered (A) Date.


üëâ So technically, the Circuit Delivered Date is ‚Äúset‚Äù by FUZE Ordering, derived from WFM‚Äôs Transport Completed milestone.

üìå How You Can Word It in RCA / Jira

> Based on analysis, WFM does not directly send Circuit Delivered Date.
WFM sends Transport Completed Est/Act Dates, which FUZE Ordering consumes and reflects as ‚ÄúIN EFFECT Date‚Äù (Circuit Delivered).
This IN EFFECT Date should flow via onefiber-sync-service into FUZE Projects (PROJ_TRANSPORT_ATTRIBUTES.transContrFocAcDt).
The issue is that this mapping/update is failing, so the Circuit Delivered Date appears in Ordering but not in Projects.
