**Subject:** Request for WFM Project Details and Support  

Hi Kamanuru Raghuveer,  

I hope you're doing well.  

Could you please share the details of the modules you have worked on in the WFM project? I also need your help in setting up the code for the specific services you worked on.  

Additionally, it would be great if you could share any WFM KT videos and documents you have. Also, please provide the list of POCs we need to connect with for different services.  

For my reference, can you also share the Jira ticket numbers you have resolved and the ones you are currently working on?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Thanks & Regards,
