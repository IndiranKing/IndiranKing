**Subject:** [PEDS-1406] COOS - DF Order Manual Creation Screen Issue (WFM - Project-Initiation & Consumption-UI)

Hi Team,

I am writing to report an issue related to the DF order manual creation screen in the **WFM - project-initiation & consumption-ui** application, as tracked under **JIRA Ticket No: PEDS-1406**.

While creating a project through Canvas, specifically in the field:  
**[Fiber Assignment / Access / Network Fulfillment / All service type]**,  
the redirection currently points to the following URLs based on the environment:

- **UAT:**  
  `https://coe-1f-services-uat.ebiz.verizon.com/consumption-ui/#/project-details#vzid=swriin?navRefresh`

- **PRD:**  
  `https://coe-1f-services.verizon.com/consumption-ui/#/project-details#vzid=swriin?navRefresh`

- **SIT:**  
  `https://coe-1f-services-sit-east.ebiz.verizon.com/consumption-ui/#/project-details#vzid=swriin?navRefresh`

Upon investigation, I found that the correct and working URLs (when accessed directly) are as follows:

- **SIT:**  
  `https://coe-1f-services-sit-east.ebiz.verizon.com/consumption-ui/#/project-details?vzid=swriin`

- **PRD:**  
  `https://coe-1f-services.verizon.com/consumption-ui/#/project-details?vzid=swriin`

- **UAT:**  
  `https://coe-1f-services-uat.ebiz.verizon.com/consumption-ui/#/project-details?vzid=swriin`

I tried replacing the old URLs with the working ones inside the **iframe** within the Canvas application. However, the URLs are still not loading as expected inside the iframe, although they work fine when accessed outside of it.

Could you please help investigate why these URLs are not rendering properly within the iframe? It may be related to security policies (like X-Frame-Options) or content security restrictions from the source application.

Looking forward to your assistance.

Best regards,  
**Indiran S.**
