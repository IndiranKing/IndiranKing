Sandberg, Troy CharlesThe issue is user is trying to delete hub parent but there is no deleted button (Need to remove the parent child relationship for project 16040203 as they are not relevant to the parent project 16117750.)
there is a logic in the code to hide the action button when if projectType is not Initial Build' and subtype is hub_ready ,Could you please help me confirm if this is a bug or if this is the intended behavior?is its an expected logic do we need to remove the parent-child relationship mentioned in the ticket manually from the backend?
if(projectType != 'Initial Build' && associationSubType === 'HUB_READY')
