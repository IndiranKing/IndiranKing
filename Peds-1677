Title : 6 DF NFID's that are "IN EFFECT" Order Status in CE did not update FUZE SPM with Circuit Delivered (A) date

Description: 6 DF NFID's that are "IN EFFECT" Order Status in CE did not update FUZE SPM with Circuit Delivered (A) date
Please see 2 attachments. 1 is the list of DF Orders with this issue, the other attachment is an example of the issue.
All DF Orders reflect an "IN EFFECT" Date in FUZE Ordering tool, but in FUZE SPM, the Circuit Delivered (A) Date seems to have been removed. RAN team needs this date, which comes from CoE in order to final complete their work as delivered.

comments : You should just be able to re-sync the orders to the FUZE Projects so the Circuit Delivered (A) field is auto-populated

hello,

Please see AYS tickets INC014211178  (closed prematurely) and new INC014286464 for dates not flowing from COE/Canvas to SPM for the following OneFiber required fields (Est, Act; (F) and (A)):

Fiber Permits Received
Fiber Construction Started 
Cable Placed
Splice and Test

See 17152961 SMC_WEST_COL_NODE-10 - A 1807AAVK.493 for example, pictures attached.

Multiple reports of dates not flowing from 1F PMs for forecast and actual dates needed for SMC site activation in CARTN.  COE required fields needed for Transport MS, Transport Delivery section ahead of RTI and Activation on SPM side.

This issue needs immediate escalation to Dev on both sides to test and resolve.  Data sent is not received, with negative impact on multiple SMC Cband site activations.

Project Id: 123456789;

FYR: this has been synced when we try through manually.
