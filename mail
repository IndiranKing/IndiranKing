Subject: Clarification on Circuit Delivery Date Not Updating

Hi [POC Name],

During my analysis, I found that the Circuit Delivery Date is not getting updated correctly in FUZE.

From my investigation:

When the completion event occurs, the system tries to update the CIRCUIT_DELIVERY_EST/ACT fields.

However, these updates are not persisting because the trigger ONEF_TRG_PROJ_TRANSPORT_ATTRIBUTES_BEFORE_INSERT_OR_UPDATE resets or nullifies these fields based on the value of LAST_MODIFIED_BY.

Currently, only updates made by system users like Fuze-OneFiber or NARSYNC are allowed.

In our case, the update is coming with LAST_MODIFIED_BY = GEN or REQUEST, so the trigger logic is treating it as a manual update and clearing the CIRCUIT_DELIVERY fields.


Possible solution:
Extend the trigger condition to also allow system updates from GEN or REQUEST. For example:

:NEW.LAST_MODIFIED_BY not in('Fuze-OneFiber','NARSYNC','GEN','REQUEST')

This would prevent the fields from being reset when the completion event is processed by these jobs.

Could you please confirm if this solution aligns with the intended design, or if there’s another recommended approach from the FUZE side?

Thanks & Regards,
Indiran S
