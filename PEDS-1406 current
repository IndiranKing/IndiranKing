COOS - Df order manual creation screen issue.

Create Network Project allows VzB Manual users to create Manual Consumption orders. With recent chrome upgrade, this functionality is broken and users are not able to use this screen to create Manual consumption orders.

Big4 to be selected in Project Initiation screen: Fiber Assignment / Access / Network Fulfillment / All service type

When we click on Next, we are supposed to see consumption process creation related screen however currently returning blank due to CORS issue.
