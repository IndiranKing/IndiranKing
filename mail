Subject: Request for ADOM Approval â€“ FUZE Application (Vast ID: 24466)

Hi Brian,

I hope you're doing well.

I had submitted an ADOM request for the FUZE application (Vast ID: 24466) on 15/04/2025, which is currently still pending with you. I understand that you are on vacation until 28th April.

However, I have some tasks that need to be completed this week, and this access is essential. I have checked with Senthil Kumar Govinda Samy, Kshitiz Gupta, and Charan Donthu, and they all confirmed that only you have the authority to approve this request.

If possible, could you kindly approve the ADOM request at your earliest convenience? Alternatively, please let me know if there is any other way to get this access granted in your absence.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Indiran S.
