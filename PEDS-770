Hi Senthil,

Actually PEDS-641 is not the only bug that came directly from the user,
I'm putting the list of bugs that needs to be taken care of by tier-2 for your reference.
https://onejira.verizon.com/browse/PEDS-771
https://onejira.verizon.com/browse/PEDS-641
https://onejira.verizon.com/browse/PEDS-597
https://onejira.verizon.com/browse/PEDS-743

Since these need to be evaluated by tier-2 first, I'm redirecting these tickets to @Santhosh Kumar Vegi . Once he's done with his analysis, if he still needs tier-3 support, I will be available for a call or slack communication.

@Santhosh Kumar Vegi Kindly take a look at these tickets.

Thanks & Regards,
Shaik Salma
