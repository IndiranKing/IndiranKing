work
Had a call with Shashank today and gather the info about the issue and it is only appearing in the production environment. Got some documents from him regarding how to cancel, create nfid. We'll go through the documents and  try to reproduce the issue in UAT environment.
Requested tier 2 team( Dhanushkodi G ) for production logs to analyze the issue. As the issue is not reproducible in UAT environment.
After going through the sys-infra code we have not find any clue and thought of running the sysinfra code locally with the payload. Got the payload from Shashank through one nfid while checking the code flow in canvas. Tried to run the sys infra code locally but ended up with few build errors. Waiting for Agrahari, Shashank's time to fix the build errors and run the sysinfra code locally.
I tried running the app in local and it is running fine,

reply from Shanshank Agrahari
Hi @Indiran S ,

As discussed over the slack, it was an intermittent issue & Now I am not seeing any gap with the functionality of the NFID Cancellation &, working fine as expected. Pls go ahead mark the story as Done. If you've added any code changes or config changes then do let me know. 

Can you pls check with the reporter as well before closing ? 

Thanks & Regards,
Shashank Agrahari
