Could you help me in identifying the service responsible for this status change...?

Sumedha Parsewar -> it must be project-service
Sumedha Parsewar -> edge imp f date is changed may be some logic might be there which can change cq status...like we have in ae mile stone
when edge imp F date changes it might be internally triggering Cq status. Check with CQ team, they can help you might be. also it started with edge impl F date there might be a forecast rule for that
Also, their might be some procs, which will be doing this internally
you may be need to check with someone who worked on edge impl milestone

Raja -> @Sumedha Parsewar I don't think so there is any link between CQ and Edge. For IB projects all Edge tasks will be N/A by default, we only have mod flows active
