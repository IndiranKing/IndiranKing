============================

The CIRCUIT DELIVERED Date from CANVAS / CoE – is not being retained in various FUZE SPM Projects for Des Moines.
As you can see from the PIC below, the Circuit Delivered (A) was sent to FUZE Ordering and then to FUZE SPM, but now the date is missing and it is required for FUZE to complete the Project requirements.

This is the list of Sites with missing Circuit Delivered (A) Dates


QUESTION:  Can CoE re-push the Circuit Delivered dates to FUZE for the attached list of DF Orders? 
If not, can FUZE re-push the “IN EFFECT” Date from FUZE Ordering to FUZE Projects?

Per PIC Below, the IN EFFECT Date for the Circuit Delivered Date is still seen in the FUZE Order, but it is no longer in FUZE SPM Project updates from CoE


Example

https://fuzeuat.verizon.com/onefiber/app/jsp/onefiber-ordering/order-view.jsp?orderNumber=10027064  working
https://fuzeuat.verizon.com/spm/projects.jsp?projectId=15252415   working                            "transContrFocFcDt": "04/19/2020"

https://fuzeuat.verizon.com/onefiber/app/jsp/onefiber-ordering/order-view.jsp?orderNumber=10027061  working

Expected 
"transContrFocFcDt": "05/16/2020",   working
issue
"transContrFocAcDt": ""              not working

comment : Circuit delivered is populated based on the order completion 


PROJ_TRANSPORT_ATTRIBUTES table is responable for to display fuze spm UI
coulam name TRANS_CONTR_FOC_FC_DT


The Main Think is we have 2 FUZE UI screen 
1st is get date from onef-ordercollection-service (Date visiable ) it get data from Order id
2nd is get from projects-service (Date Not visiable) it get data from project id 

======================
